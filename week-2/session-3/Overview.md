Today we reviewed some Eloquent JavaScript programs using loops. We went into more depth on operators and strings, and explored a number of string methods.

## Reading & Homework

Read [Chapter 3 of Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html) to prepare for Thursday's lesson.

Continue working through the **Intro to JS prep-work** if you have not reached week-4 already.

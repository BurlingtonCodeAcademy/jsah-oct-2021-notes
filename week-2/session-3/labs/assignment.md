# Lab: Assignments

Let's take a few minutes to play around with assignment operators, so go ahead open up a node environment in your terminal, and let's figure some things out.

- assign a variable x using the let keyword to a numerical value.

- assign a variable y using the const keyword to a numerical value.

- add a value to x using the += operator. What's the value of x?

- add a value to y using the += operator. Did you get the value you expected?

- create a variable named string that is a string.

- add a value to string using +=, what is the value of string?
- What is the value of string if you use -= instead?

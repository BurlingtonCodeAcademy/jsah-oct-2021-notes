# Lab: Compare and Contrast

Open up a node environment in your terminal, and let's play around with some comparison operators.

- What happens when you compare two strings with greater than > `?`

- Did it give you the value you expected?
- What do you think it's using to compare the two?
- What's the difference between the double equals `==` and triple equals `===`?

- Are two empty arrays equal to each other? How about two arrays with identical content?
